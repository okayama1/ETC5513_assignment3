# Assignment 3

This is the repo for ETC5513 Assignment 3 due on Monday May 9 at 9:30am (Melbourne time).
Please use the template and data provided in this repo.


# The Goals of The Assignment:

- Demonstrate that you are capable of creating a **group reproducible pdf** report using RStudio, Git and GitHub using all the tools that we have learned.
- Confirm that you are able to clone a repository locally and synchronize the changes to the remote GitHub repo.
- Confirm that you can create meaningful commits so that the changes and the history of the project can be tracked.
- Show that you can create and merge branches as well as resolve conflicts.
- Please use the template provided in this repo. For this assignment, you do **not** need to modify the template. Also ensure that you do **not** include all the R code and R messages in the report output. You may choose to output code parts if those are relevant for the report output.


# Tasks 

Work in group of three (same as in Tutorial 8) to create a reproducible and collaborative report where **each team member will**:

**Select two countries from the data set and choose two research questions to answer within their section (please remember that you can use subsections within your section)** 

- Ensure that inside your section you have a **figure** and a **table** that are *both referenced in the text*. In addition, add a **paper/book reference** into the text too and **update the bib file** with the reference. Write a paragraph with no more than 100-150 words to discuss your answer to the research question in your section referring to the figure and table.
- To help you with your data wrangling and figures, have a look at the demo template of week 8 lecture. 
- In this end, this report will need to have a very short intro (no more than 150 words), three or four sections (depending on how many members are in the team) and a reference section with any relevant information.

**While each team member will work on their section. The final report will need to have a combine intro, a combine conclusions and combine references using a bib file.**

# Data set

The data set for this exercise was obtained from the World Bank data base and contains the following variables:

- Country name
- Region: Geographical region
- Income group
- CO2 emissions: Measure in metric tons per capita
- Urban population: Population living in urban locations
- Energy use kg of oil_equivalent per capita: Energy use here refers to use of primary energy before transformation to other end-use fuels


# Logistics (very important!)

- Please nominate a person in your group to first access the repository on this link (https://classroom.github.com/a/2lMZUBNQ). Ensure that you are logged in into your GitHub account before using the link. Create a group with your Tutorial 8 group's name.
- Then the other group members please use the same link (https://classroom.github.com/a/2lMZUBNQ). Please follow the instructions, **look for your group and join the group**.
- If you encounter a 404 error, please go to the top-right corner and sign in into your GitHub account.
- Once all the group members have joined the group in GitHub classrooms, you can all start working on the project.
- Each group member must then **clone the repository in your local machine and create a branch to work on your own section**. Please name the branch using your name and surname (**name_surname**).
- Each group member will work on one section (if there are four of you in the group, please create a new section in the report.Rmd file).
- Ensure that you stage, commit and push the changes that you are making into your own branch from time to time as you are creating your own section (do not leave it all to the end).
- While you work on your section, please ensure that you work in your branch and commit and push changes into your **own branch** in the remote repository too. That will minimize conflicts.
- Also ensure that you fetch the contents of the remote repository from time to time (do not leave that to the end).
- Once your section is complete, please merge your branch into your repo and deal with any possible conflicts. 
- It might be helpful to set up a Zoom meeting with your group members once you are ready to merge your branch into the master branch to create the final report. One of the members at a time can merge his/her branch with the master while sharing screen with the others. That way you can help each other fix conflicts and that will ensure that you are not merging different branches at the same time, which might cause more complicated merging conflicts.


# Due Date

- Assignment is due on Monday May 9 at 9:30am (Melbourne time). **Late submissions will not be accepted.**
- By the due date, all the changes in your repo need to be merged to the master branch.
- If GitHub repos are modified after the submission date. The assignment will be marked with a 0.
- GitHub repos that are not reproducible (i.e if the report **cannot** be reproduced from the files in the GitHub repo) will be marked with a 0.


# Assignment Submission 

**Each team member must submit:**

- In Moodle: paste the http of the team GitHub repo (**submissions that do not contain this information to reproduce the report will be considered non-reproducible**). Ensure that all your paths are relative to the project folder.
- Upload the *Rmd file* of the project.
- Upload the *pdf file* of the project.
- **Incomplete submissions (missing any files or information requested in these instructions) will be graded with a 0**
- Important:
    - Your GitHub repo including all the history will also be marked. 
    - Do not worry if you encountered problems during the commits, branching or merging. The important thing is that all the conflicts are resolved and you have your final report in the last commit of your master branch. That will show that you are able to use the tools!
    - **All the files** used to create the report need to be included in the GitHub repository. **If the report cannot be reproduced from the clone repository, the assignment will be considered not reproducible and will be marked with a 0**.
